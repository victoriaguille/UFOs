# UFOs

## Overview Of Project
####
Dana, a writer, has wanted to provide a webpage that allows users to search through UFO reports while also reading some of her writing on the subject. The data for the UFO encounters are stored in a JavaScript file, making it easy to work alongside an html file with an additional JavaScript file with specific code. With straightforward html tags and corresponding JavaScript code, a table is populated with the UFO encounters, making it easy for any site visitors to browse a variety of reports. On the left hand side of the table, text boxes are placed to allow users to enter search terms to only bring up specific types of UFO encounters in the table that meet the search criteria. This simple, but polished user interface gives potential visitors a chance to look at UFO encounter data that may have not been accessible otherwise. 

## Search Results
####
Upon accessing the webpage for UFO encounters, a user will be greeted with the title, a small blurb from Dana, filtering options, and a table of all the UFO encounters currently housed in a data JavaScript file. Once the user has read over the blurb about UFO encounters, the only other interactive element on the page are the input fields for the filtering criteria. If someone would like to look through the data for a specific location, such as Arizona, United States, they would simply need to type in the state and country name in the corresponding blank fields. In this example, the user has also selected an additional search criteria, 1/1/2010.

As the user begins typing in new search terms, the table will begin filtering, however, the user may need to also select the enter button when all of the search terms are typed. This particular search request only brings up a single encounter, as shown below. But, the user can easily make changes or select different filtering terms by either refreshing the page or selecting the initial title of the webpage at the top of the window. Generally, there are very few steps to interact with the table of data and it is fairly straightforward. Any potential visitor to the webpage would have little issue interacting with the UFO data.

## Summary
####
Overall, this approach to using JavaScript and HTML to create an interactive search engine of UFO encounters is a great idea and use of coding knowledge. However, there are a few drawbacks that could be improved upon. In the search filters, there is no mention of the duration of the encounter or the comments. This can greatly limit the kind of search a user can perform. The user must also have a knowledge of the correct spelling of locations, unless there will be a lack of results if there is a single misspelling. One way to approach the spelling concern would be to modify the JavaScript code to accept variations in inputs, which would in turn make the filtering experience more user friendly. 
####
Another potential recommendation that could build upon the first recommendation, would be to add a filtering option for the comments. Being able to search for specific phrases or words from the comments of the UFO encounters would give users a better idea of what the encounter was like or even provide encounters that can now be grouped together that may have not been able to with the current filtering options. This new filtering option combined with the recommendation to accept similiar search requests would make the table of data easier to interact with. Without these two suggested changes, a visitor to the webpage would need to know what was in the table of data to properly search through it. This could be problematic especially if more data is added to the JavaScript array that holds all of the UFO encounters. It also would be an issue if a visitor to the web page was not well-versed in UFO sightings and was uncertain of how to filter the table of data initially.
