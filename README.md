# UFOs

## Overview Of Project
####
Dana, a writer, has wanted to provide a webpage that allows users to search through UFO reports while also reading some of her writing on the subject. The data for the UFO encounters are stored in a JavaScript file, making it easy to work alongside an html file with an additional JavaScript file with specific code. With straightforward html tags and corresponding JavaScript code, a table is populated with the UFO encounters, making it easy for any site visitors to browse a variety of reports. On the left hand side of the table, text boxes are placed to allow users to enter search terms to only bring up specific types of UFO encounters in the table that meet the search criteria. This simple, but polished user interface gives potential visitors a chance to look at UFO encounter data that may have not been accessible otherwise. 

## Search Results

once code is working, will outline how to use search criteria/filtering process w/ images

## Summary
####
in general, this is a great way to use code and html/css to create an interactive search engine of ufo encounters. there is a drawback, though. doesn't allow to search for duration or comments. this could be limiting for those wanting to know more than location and shape. an improvement to this web page would be to search comments. searching comments would allow a user to look for specific things in a ufo encounter. another potential recommendation would be to make the search criteria accept multiple spellings or similiar enough text to bring up an encounter. combination of comment searching and similiar search requests would make the table of data easier to search for what a user would like. Without those two things, the user must know the exact info to pull results.
