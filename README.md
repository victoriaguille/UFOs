# UFOs

## Overview Of Project
####
Dana, a writer, has wanted to provide a webpage that allows users to search through UFO reports while also reading some of her writing on the subject. The data for the UFO encounters are stored in a JavaScript file, making it easy to work alongside an html file with an additional JavaScript file with specific code. With straightforward html tags and corresponding JavaScript code, a table is populated with the UFO encounters, making it easy for any site visitors to browse a variety of reports. On the left hand side of the table, text boxes are placed to allow users to enter search terms to only bring up specific types of UFO encounters in the table that meet the search criteria. This simple, but polished user interface gives potential visitors a chance to look at UFO encounter data that may have not been accessible otherwise. 

## Search Results

once code is working, will outline how to use search criteria/filtering process w/ images

## Summary
####
Overall, this approach to using JavaScript and HTML to create an interactive search engine of UFO encounters is a great idea and use of coding knowledge. However, there are a few drawbacks that could be improved upon. In the search filters, there is no mention of the duration of the encounter or the comments. This can greatly limit the kind of search a user can perform. The user must also have a knowledge of the correct spelling of locations, unless there will be a lack of results if there is a single misspelling. One way to approach the spelling concern would be to modify the JavaScript code to accept variations in inputs, which would in turn make the filtering experience more user friendly. 
####
Another potential recommendation that could build upon the first recommendation, would be to add a filtering option for the comments. Being able to search for specific phrases or words from the comments of the UFO encounters would give users a better idea of what the encounter was like or even provide encounters that can now be grouped together that may have not been able to with the current filtering options. This new filtering option combined with the recommendation to accept similiar search requests would make the table of data easier to interact with. Without these two suggested changes, a visitor to the webpage would need to know what was in the table of data to properly search through it. This could be problematic especially if more data is added to the JavaScript array that holds all of the UFO encounters. It also would be an issue if a visitor to the web page was not well-versed in UFO sightings and was uncertain of how to filter the table of data initially.
